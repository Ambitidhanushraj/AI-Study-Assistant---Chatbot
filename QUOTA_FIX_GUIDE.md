# OpenAI API Quota Issue - Resolution Guide

## What Happened

Your AI Study Assistant is working correctly, but you've hit the **OpenAI API quota limit**. This means your OpenAI account has run out of credits or hit usage limits.

## Error Details

- **Error Type**: Rate Limit / Quota Exceeded (429)
- **Message**: "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details"
- **Status**: Your API key is working, but you need to add billing information

## How to Fix This

### Option 1: Add Billing to Your OpenAI Account (Recommended)

1. **Visit OpenAI Billing**: Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. **Add Payment Method**: Add a credit card or other payment method
3. **Choose a Plan**: Select a plan that fits your usage needs
4. **Verify**: Your account will be activated immediately

### Option 2: Use Free Credits (If Available)

1. **Check Free Credits**: Visit https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of your remaining credits
3. **Wait for Reset**: Free credits typically reset monthly

### Option 3: Use Alternative API (Future Enhancement)

The app can be configured to use alternative AI providers like:

- Groq API
- Anthropic Claude
- Local AI models

## What's Working Now

âœ… **File Upload**: PDF files are accepted and stored  
âœ… **Text Input**: Manual text pasting works perfectly  
âœ… **Fallback Responses**: When quota is exceeded, you get helpful guidance  
âœ… **Quiz Generation**: Can still generate quizzes from your content  
âœ… **UI**: All interface features work normally

## What You'll See

When you try to chat and hit the quota limit, you'll now see:

1. **Warning Toast**: "OpenAI API quota exceeded - showing fallback response"
2. **Helpful Message**: The AI will explain the situation and provide alternatives
3. **Clear Guidance**: Instructions on how to resolve the issue

## Testing the Fix

1. **Add billing to your OpenAI account**
2. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for the changes to take effect
3. **Try chatting again** - it should work normally
4. **Monitor usage** at https://platform.openai.com/usage

## Cost Information

- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens (very affordable)
- **Typical chat**: 1-5 cents per conversation
- **Free tier**: $5 credit when you add billing (enough for many conversations)
